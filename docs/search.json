Similarly, the third graph reiterates this idea by presenting the count of all shadow predictions per year. From these graphs, it is obvious that there is a growing number of predictions by different groundhogs. The growth in groundhog day popularity is especially visible when we view the third graph in conjunction with the second graph showing the consistency and recency in groundhog count of predictions. In the second graph, we can see that earlier groundhogs have had a greater impact on the data for winter predictions."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn this project, I will use data from the TidyTuesday folder for February 2, 2025. The original data is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashant111/the-simpsons-dataset, which is a kraggle data set authored by Prashant Banerjee. This data is further scraped by other users. The data is split into four data frames of characters, episodes, locations, and script lines.

Characters that appear earlier in the character id line seem to be prominent to appear as prolific characters. The next step in this data is to identify a match between character id to character name across data frames to better understand which characters are favored for lines. If we were to exclude the main Simpson family, which characters would receive the most attention?"

    "title": "Federalist Papers Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis is project 2 which seeks to work with string and character data. The data used comes from nicholasjhorton’s GitHub repository which provides a data frame for the Federalist papers.\nEstablishing a Government\nSince the purpose of the Federalist Papers is to defend the Constitution that establishes the U.S government branches, I proceeded to examine how many times this purpose is linked through mentions of the words “government”. I provided an alternative “confederacy” due to its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation, as a name for government in reference to the United States.\n\nCountry_FedPapers &lt;- FederalistPapers |&gt;\n  mutate(Country_FedPapers = str_to_lower(text))|&gt;\n  group_by(paper) |&gt;\n  summarise(Word_count = sum(str_count(text,\"government\") + \n              str_count(text,\"confederacy\"))) \n\nAlthough counting the occurrence of the two words does not give any context to what direction the author intends to take the paper, the repetition of the words provides a hint.\nGraphing Count of “Government” and “Confederacy”\n\nggplot(Country_FedPapers, aes(x = paper, y = Word_count)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Federalist Paper Number\",\n    y = \"Word Count\", \n    title = \"Number of times 'confederacy' or 'government' mentioned\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph, we can see a consistent call upon government and confederacy with the highest count being around paper 45 which describes the power of the government relative to state governments, so it is possible the constant mention of the two forms of government caused the spike.\nTitle Length per Paper\nAnother alteration to the data I will apply is separating the title into its generic FEDERALIST No. and its assigned title. From here I analyze the length of each title.\n\nNeater_Fedpaper &lt;- FederalistPapers |&gt;\n  mutate(solo_title = str_extract(title,\"(?&lt;=\\\\. ).+\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(paper) |&gt;\n  summarize(title_length = str_length(first(solo_title)))\n\nGraph of Title Length vs Specific Word Count\nThen will the length of the title tell anything about the wordiness of the author? In other words, will the length of the title predict the amount of times the words confederacy and government appear?\n\nJoined_Fedpaper &lt;- left_join(Country_FedPapers, Neater_Fedpaper)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(paper)`\n\nggplot(Joined_Fedpaper, aes( x = title_length , y = Word_count)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Length of Title\",\n    y = \"Count of government and confederacy\",\n    title = \"Does title length predict utterances of government?\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no easily visible marked trend. A longer title does not relate to a longer string of confederacies and government mentions that may appear in longer papers.\nConstitution and What Else?\nIn an attempt to contextualize what is referred to as the Constitution in the Federalist papers, the following code draws out the words following the word constitution.\n\nFederalistPapers |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(text, \"(?i)constitution\"))|&gt;\n  group_by(paper)|&gt;\n  summarize(surr_const = str_c(unlist(\n    str_extract_all(text, \"(?i)constitution\\\\s+(\\\\w+)\")), collapse = \", \"))  \n\n# A tibble: 77 × 2\n   paper surr_const                                                            \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                                                 \n 1     1 \"Constitution for, CONSTITUTION TO, CONSTITUTION and, Constitution or\"\n 2     6 \"\"                                                                    \n 3     7 \"\"                                                                    \n 4     8 \"constitution that\"                                                   \n 5     9 \"constitution that\"                                                   \n 6    10 \"Constitution forms\"                                                  \n 7    14 \"Constitution From, Constitution are, Constitution is\"                \n 8    15 \"constitution of\"                                                     \n 9    16 \"Constitution which, constitution in\"                                 \n10    17 \"\"                                                                    \n# ℹ 67 more rows\n\n\nAlthought the code does not give much context as the words following the mention of constitution are largely filler words, it does highlight the different instances of constitution. The capitalized Constitution is likely a direct reference to the U.S. Constitution. The completely capitalized CONSTITUTION is likely referenced in an address to the reader or some outstanding instance while the completely lowercase constitution is the general constitute of something.\nWho Wrote the Most?\nFrom a brief look at the authorship of each paper, it can be seen that Hamilton took authorship of most, but how many words did they write across their papers?\n\n FederalistPapers |&gt;\n  group_by(author) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_words = sum(str_count(text, \"\\\\S+\")))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  author   total_words\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1 Hamilton      114076\n2 Jay             8513\n3 Madison        69377\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Hamilton wrote like he was running out of time and ended with 114,076 words across his many authored papers."
