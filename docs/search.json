The goal of the test is to confirm the claims of the article in which the data was used to answer the question: Is there a significant difference in education scores between different-sized towns? The data is taken from the UK Office for National Statistics.\nLink to the data:\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-01-23/readme.md\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/\n\nsize_interest &lt;- english_education |&gt;\n  filter(size_flag == \"Medium Towns\"| size_flag ==\"Small Towns\", na.rm = TRUE)\n\nThe selected variable to analyze is the education score of medium and small towns.\n\nggplot(size_interest, aes(x = size_flag, y = education_score)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Education Score Distribution\", x = \"City Size\", y = \"Score\")+\ntheme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is hard to tell by the graph how much they differ by as the averages seem to be close.\nSingle permutation\n\npermutation_test &lt;- function(reps,data) {\n  data |&gt;\n    select(size_flag, education_score)|&gt;\n    mutate(edu_perm = sample(education_score, replace = FALSE)) |&gt;\n    group_by(size_flag) |&gt;\n    summarize(mean_score = mean(education_score, na.rm = TRUE), mean_perm = mean(edu_perm)) |&gt;\n    summarize(mean_diff = abs(diff(mean_score)), mean_perm_diff = diff(mean_perm))\n  }\n\nFrom the permutation test, we can determine how likely these score distributions are to be achieved by chance.\nRepeated simulated trials\n\nset.seed(123)\nunder_null &lt;- map(1:10000, permutation_test, data = size_interest) |&gt;\n  list_rbind()\n\nPlot distribution\n\nggplot(under_null, aes(x = mean_perm_diff)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean_diff, color = \"red\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Permutation Under Null\",\n       x = \"Difference in Mean Scores\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph shows the distribution of runs under the permutation conditions.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis is project 2, which seeks to work with string and character data. The data used comes from nicholasjhorton’s GitHub repository, which provides a data frame for the Federalist Papers. The text files are taken from Project Gutenberg. The data can be found here: https://github.com/nicholasjhorton/FederalistPapers/ .\nEstablishing a Government\nSince the purpose of the Federalist Papers is to defend the Constitution that establishes the U.S government branches, I proceeded to examine how many times this purpose is linked through mentions of the words “government”. I provided an alternative “confederacy” due to its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation, as a name for government in reference to the United States.\n\nCountry_FedPapers &lt;- FederalistPapers |&gt;\n  mutate(Country_FedPapers = str_to_lower(text))|&gt;\n  group_by(paper) |&gt;\n  summarise(Word_count = sum(str_count(text,\"government\") + \n              str_count(text,\"confederacy\"))) \nhead(Country_FedPapers)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  paper Word_count\n  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1     1          6\n2     2          9\n3     3         18\n4     4         22\n5     5          6\n6     6          3\n\n\nAlthough counting the occurrence of the two words does not give any context to what direction the author intends to take the paper, the repetition of the words provides a hint.\nGraphing Count of “Government” and “Confederacy”\n\nggplot(Country_FedPapers, aes(x = paper, y = Word_count)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Federalist Paper Number\",\n    y = \"Word Count\", \n    title = \"Number of times 'confederacy' or 'government' mentioned\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph, we can see a consistent call upon government and confederacy with the highest count being paper 46 which describes the power of the government relative to state governments, so it is possible the constant mention of the two forms of government caused the spike.\nTitle Length per Paper\nAnother alteration to the data I will apply is separating the title into its generic FEDERALIST No. and its assigned title. From here I analyze the length of each title.\n\nNeater_Fedpaper &lt;- FederalistPapers |&gt;\n  mutate(solo_title = str_extract(title,\"(?&lt;=\\\\. ).+\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(paper) |&gt;\n  summarize(title_length = str_length(first(solo_title)))\n\nGraph of Title Length vs Specific Word Count\nThen will the length of the title tell anything about the wordiness of the author? In other words, will the length of the title predict the amount of times the words confederacy and government appear?\n\nJoined_Fedpaper &lt;- left_join(Country_FedPapers, Neater_Fedpaper, by = \"paper\")\n\nggplot(Joined_Fedpaper, aes( x = title_length , y = Word_count)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Length of Title\",\n    y = \"Count of government and confederacy\",\n    title = \"Does title length predict utterances of government?\"\n  )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no easily visible marked trend. A longer title does not relate to a longer string of confederacies and government mentions that may appear in longer papers.\nConstitution and What Else?\nIn an attempt to contextualize what is referred to as the Constitution in the Federalist papers, the following code draws out the words following the word constitution.\n\nFederalistPapers |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(text, \"(?i)constitution\"))|&gt;\n  group_by(paper)|&gt;\n  summarize(surr_const = str_c(unlist(\n    str_extract_all(text, \"(?i)constitution\\\\s+(\\\\w+)\")), collapse = \", \"))  \n\n# A tibble: 77 × 2\n   paper surr_const                                                            \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                                                 \n 1     1 \"Constitution for, CONSTITUTION TO, CONSTITUTION and, Constitution or\"\n 2     6 \"\"                                                                    \n 3     7 \"\"                                                                    \n 4     8 \"constitution that\"                                                   \n 5     9 \"constitution that\"                                                   \n 6    10 \"Constitution forms\"                                                  \n 7    14 \"Constitution From, Constitution are, Constitution is\"                \n 8    15 \"constitution of\"                                                     \n 9    16 \"Constitution which, constitution in\"                                 \n10    17 \"\"                                                                    \n# ℹ 67 more rows\n\n\nAlthought the code does not give much context as the words following the mention of constitution are largely filler words, it does highlight the different instances of constitution. The capitalized Constitution is likely a direct reference to the U.S. Constitution. The completely capitalized CONSTITUTION is likely referenced in an address to the reader or some outstanding instance while the completely lowercase constitution is the general constitute of something.\nWho Wrote the Most?\nFrom a brief look at the authorship of each paper, it can be seen that Hamilton took authorship of most, but how many words did they write across their papers?\n\n FederalistPapers |&gt;\n  group_by(author) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_words = sum(str_count(text, \"\\\\S+\")))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  author   total_words\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1 Hamilton      114076\n2 Jay             8513\n3 Madison        69377\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Hamilton wrote like he was running out of time and ended with 114,076 words across his many authored papers."

Similarly, the third graph reiterates this idea by presenting the count of all shadow predictions per year. From these graphs, it is obvious that there is a growing number of predictions by different groundhogs. The growth in groundhog day popularity is especially visible when we view the third graph in conjunction with the second graph showing the consistency and recency in groundhog count of predictions. In the second graph, we can see that earlier groundhogs have had a greater impact on the data for winter predictions."

Characters in the main cast naturally have more lines, but there is a large difference between the character with the highest word count (Homer) and the character with the second highest word count (Marge). This can be attributed to Homer being the protagonist. When we exclude the Simpsons family, Moe is the character with the most words said. There is a notable drop between Moe and Lisa Simpson, signaling the end of the main cast. Would an avid Simpsons fan consider this character’s word count surprising?"

    "text": "Two articles:\n\nHow Target leveraged predictive analytics to improve marketing ROI. OvationMR. Retrieved from https://www.ovationmr.com/how-target-leveraged-predictive-analytics/\n\n\n\nDuhigg, C. (2012, February 16). How companies learn your secrets. The New York Times Magazine. https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html\n\nSummary\nIn 2012, the New York Times released an article with the headline, “How Companies Learn Your Secrets”. The big story of this article was how Target asked a statistician, Andrew Pole, whom they hired to identify pregnant customers so they could tailor their marketing before any other company could capitalize on the spending habits of new parents. The article further dives into the work of predictive analytics and how companies use customer habits to determine how to better sell a product. The reporter, Charles Duhigg, states that when Target was made aware of his article, they stated that they were in compliance with Privacy Laws and critiqued inaccuracies in his reporting, but would not elaborate or meet with him for further discussion. Further development by Pole on the targeted advertisement was to address possibly scaring their customers by alerting them they knew their personal profile or information before they had a purchase history of it. To overcome this, a layer of mixed advertisement with targeted advertisement would hide this.\nOvationMR takes the prior article discussed as a launching point for their own advertisement. The website uses the New York Times article as a case study to learn strategies and marketing growth from. Calling its resolution a success, with Target being able to “maintain its customer relationships while respecting their privacy.”\n\nWhat was the consent structure for recruiting participants? Were the participants aware of the ways their data would be used for research? Was informed consent possible? Can you provide informed consent for applications that are yet foreseen?\nFrom the New York Times article, it is shown the consent structure is not fully seen by the customer as it is a silent agreement that purchase history will be retained by the company. In this case, like in many marketing departments, a user profile is created for the customers to track engagement across what the store offers, including coupons, surveys, refunds, purchases, etc. The customers were not aware that Target would transform the data collected on them into a prediction system of their potential pregnancy status. Informed consent of the full situation was not sought after since this fits within company privacy laws that allow it to maintain information for marketing purposes, but a concent is implied to give the company data when purchasing from them. Although the purpose could be deduced early on when advertisements specifically showed baby items alone.\nWhat was the data collection process? Were the observations collected ethically? Are there missing observations?\nThe data collection process was based on identifying customer behavior patterns and technically on legal grounds and respecting privacy, as Target only made conclusions based on what customers would purchase. OvationMR encourages the practice of data tracking with existing models and third party resources that follow privacy laws. This further drives the point of widespread data tracking.\nIs the data identifiable? All of it? Some of it? In what way? Are the data sufficiently anonymized or old to be free of ethical concerns? Is anonymity guaranteed?\nWhile this data is not publicly available, in earlier advertising efforts, it could be deduced that pregnancy was implied and therefore gave a piece of private information to whoever encountered the advertisement in connection with the customer, as was the case for the angry father and his teenage daughter. The revised advertisement model better hides the privacy issue as it is theoretically undetectable even by the target customer. However, holding the information of someone being pregnant without their knowledge is a privacy issue on its own, as the customer has not sought to make this personal information available to Target. Forming such a sensible data set can risk customer privacy if there is a data breach. If third-party advertisement, as brought up by OvationMR, is taken into consideration, then information from Target can end up elsewhere.\n10.Respect and invite fair criticism while promoting the identification and open discussion of errors, risks, and unintended consequences of our work.\nOvationMR reviewed the criticism Target received as a need to reanalyze their marketing strategy rather than an overstep. From the New York Times, it is reported that Target refused to give a statement to Pole, which means in light of their predictive analytics, they failed a point of the manifesto. By refusing to engage in conversation over their data collection and analysis, they in some form acknowledged that it was not the most well-handled data. It refused direct criticism but answered to customer criticism not by removing the ads but by disguising them."

    "text": "The data for this analysis comes from the Stanford Open Policing Project, published in Pierson et al. (2020). Which can be found in https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/. In this project, I want to compare reasonable driving stops for drivers across states. First, I will compare drivers from California and Florida with the tentative question: Which state has better drivers? To answer this question, I will find and compare the proportion of stops that resulted in a citation for each state. On a second analysis, I will utilize Philadelphia’s data frame to find that searches provided resulted in a reasonable cause when performed. This follows the question: Did they have the right suspicion? I will extract the number of searches that found contraband and compare it to the total number of searches conducted.\nBetter Drivers\nIn this analysis, the statewide reports of LA and FL are used to form a comparison of the proportion of drivers issued a citation. Since the coverage rate for state wide reports did not reach 100%, 69.8% and % for California and Florida, respectively, two cities in these states were chose as representatives of the state. Thereby we compare San Francisco drivers with Tampa drivers. Two cities with large populations.\n\nSELECT\n    state,\n    COUNT(*) AS total_stops,\n    SUM(citation_issued) AS citations,\n    ROUND(SUM(citation_issued) / COUNT(*), 2) AS citation_rate\nFROM (\n    SELECT\n        'CA' AS state,\n         citation_issued\n    FROM ca_san_francisco_2020_04_01\n\n    UNION ALL\n\n    SELECT\n        'FL' AS state,\n        citation_issued\n    FROM fl_tampa_2020_04_01\n) combined\nGROUP BY state\nORDER BY citation_rate DESC;\n\n\nhead(prop_table)\n\n  state total_stops citations citation_rate\n1    FL     2818240   2818240           1.0\n2    CA      905070    631660           0.7\n\n\nThe table shows numerically how many stops and how many of those stops resulted in citations.\n\nggplot(prop_table, aes(x = state, y = citation_rate)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Drivers Issued Citations by State Patrol\",\n    x = \"State\",\n    y = \"Citation Rate\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph, it can be seen that there is a large difference between the proportion of drivers who were stopped AND received a citation in San Francisco, California and Tampa, Florida. While no conclusions can be drawn from this snippet of data, it can be speculated that perhaps Californian drivers are better drivers and did not commit violations that guaranteed a citation, or it could also propose the idea that traffic officers are more lenient to driving mistakes. Both show a small proportion, which could speak about the cities themselves.\nEvidence Found\nIn this analysis, the data is taken from the Philadelphia, PA table.
